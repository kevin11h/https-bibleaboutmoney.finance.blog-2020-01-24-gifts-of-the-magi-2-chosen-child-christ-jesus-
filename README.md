### [The Pilgrimage of the Magi](https://biblehub.com/bsb/matthew/2.htm)
#### MATTHEW 2:1-12


1 After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem, 2 asking, “Where is the One who has been born King of the Jews? We saw His star in the easta and have come to worship Him.”

3 When King Herod heard this, he was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him. 4When he had assembled all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired where the Christ was to be born.

5“In Bethlehem in Judea,” they replied, “for this is what the prophet has written:

> 6 ‘But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,
are by no means least among the rulers of Judah,
for out of you will come a ruler
who will be the shepherd of My people Israel.’b ”
— [Micah 5:2](https://biblehub.com/micah/5-2.htm); [2 Samuel 5:2](https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-2.htm)

7Then Herod called the Magi secretly and learned from them the exact time the star had appeared. 8And sending them to Bethlehem, he said: “Go and search carefully for the Child, and when you find Him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship Him.”

9After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stood over the place where the Child was. 10When they saw the star, they rejoiced with great delight. 11On coming to the house, they saw the Child with His mother Mary, and they fell down and worshiped Him. Then they opened their treasures and presented Him with gifts of gold and frankincense and myrrh[8].

12And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they withdrew to their country by another route.
